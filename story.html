    <h2 class="press-start">Formation and the "Blue Album"</h2>
    <p class="belgrano">
      Weezer was formed in Los Angeles in 1992 by Rivers Cuomo (lead vocals, guitar), Patrick Wilson (drums), Matt Sharp (bass), and Jason Cropper (guitar). 
      The name "Weezer" came from a childhood nickname Cuomo's father gave him, after a character in The Little Rascals.
      <br><br>
      After struggling in the L.A. grunge scene, the band recorded a demo, The Kitchen Tape, that caught the attention of Geffen Records A&R rep Todd Sullivan. 
      They signed to the label in 1993 and recorded their self-titled debut, commonly known as the "Blue Album", produced by Ric Ocasek of The Cars.
      <br><br>
      Released in May 1994, the Blue Album was a massive success, thanks to quirky, hit singles like "Undone – The Sweater Song" and "Buddy Holly" 
      (whose iconic music video spliced the band into footage from the TV show Happy Days). The album fused power pop hooks with alternative rock energy 
      and introduced the band's self-described "nerd rock" aesthetic to the mainstream.
      <br><br>
    </p>

    <h2 class="press-start">The Pinkerton Era and Hiatus</h2>
    <p class="belgrano">
      While the Blue Album made them stars, Rivers Cuomo grew disillusioned with the rock star lifestyle and enrolled at Harvard University in 1995. 
      The band's second album, Pinkerton (1996), was a darker, more visceral, and personal album recorded while Cuomo was at college and recovering
      from leg surgery. 
      <br><br>
      Named after a character in the opera Madama Butterfly, Pinkerton sold poorly compared to its predecessor and received mixed-to-negative 
      reviews at the time. The critical and commercial failure led the band to take a significant hiatus, during which Matt Sharp left the band,
      and Cuomo continued his studies and experimented with other musical projects.
    </p>

    <h2 class="press-start">Resurgence and a Prolific Career</h2>
    <p class="belgrano">
      Weezer reunited and made a triumphant return in 2000, much to the surprise of fans, selling out tours instantly. They released their third 
      album, also self-titled (known as the "Green Album"), in 2001, featuring a cleaner sound and hits like "Hash Pipe" and "Island in the Sun". 
      Scott Shriner joined as the new bassist, solidifying the current lineup.
      <br><br>
      Since then, Weezer has maintained a consistent and prolific output, releasing numerous studio albums that have varied widely in style and 
      critical reception (from the arena-ready pop-rock of Make Believe to the covers album The Teal Album and the orchestral pop of OK Human). 
      Pinkerton, once a failure, has been critically re-evaluated over time and is now considered a cult classic and a major influence on the 
      emo genre.
      <br><br>
      Today, Weezer is recognized as a staple of American rock music, known for their catchy tunes, self-aware humor, and enduring connection 
      with a multi-generational fanbase.
