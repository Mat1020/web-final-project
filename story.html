    <p class="belgrano">In this book, we're on the perspective of Michael.</p>
    
    <p class="belgrano">He is adopted by his step-father, which they provide for each other, they look out for each other, and never betray each other. They spend building boxes, special devices with mysterious abilities, that they'll sell to the mob at a price. Michael's powers are to control other people with his eyes, once they see them, no matter who it is. Due to this reason, he has to wear sunglasses most of the time.</p>
