# Web-Final-Project
These are my final website projects from both my _Intro to Computer Science_ of 2025-2026 class and _AP Computer Science_ of 2026-2027 class. These final website projects count as my final exam for those classes.

## Status: Unfinished
As of now, I'm just at my first semester project for _Intro to Computer Science_; it will eventually get better, and my GitHub repository structure gets better. 

I'm sharing my code with everyone because I'm using GitHub pages to see the real-time website--Talking about GitHub Pages, I'm planning to structure this repository as of branhes to easily change the websites.

# S1 Web Final Project for Intro to Computer Science
This is my first semester of _Intro of Computer Science_ class. For the first semester, we learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS; not JavaScript yet.

## Requirements for Web
For our websites, we needed to:
- Have an index.html, page_one.html, and page_two.html (three HTML files in total)
- Have at least two CSS files
- Use images, lists, and smth else

## Summary of My Web
So, I created a website that was meant for people to get to know Weezer; _WeezerFan_ is the website name. 

The home page is about an overveiew of Weezer like members, popular songs, etc. The second page was an "albums" page about most of Weezer albums. Finally, the third page was "story" which we goes more in depth to the story of Weezer.
