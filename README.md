# Web-Final-Project
These are my final website projects from both my _Intro to Computer Science_ of 2025-2026 class and _AP Computer Science_ of 2026-2027 class. These final website projects count as my final exam for that class.

As of now, I'm just at my first S1 (semester 1) project; it will eventually get better, or my GitHub repository structure gets better. I'm sharing my code with everyone because it includes basic concepts of HTML & CSS that I belive are important, which means that it's good practice to look at them.

## S1 for Intro to Computer Science
For this website, we needed to:

So, I created a website that was meant for people to get to know Weezer; _WeezerFan_ is the website name. 

The home page is about an overveiew of Weezer like members, popular songs, etc. The second page was an "albums" page about most of Weezer albums. Finally, the third page was "story" which we goes more in depth to the story of Weezer.
